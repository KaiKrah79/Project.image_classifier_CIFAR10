# Image Classifier project with CIFAR10 Dataset
Project code for Udacity's Introduction to Machine LEarning with PyTorch" Nanodegree program.

## Information to the project ##
The task was to build a neural network with pytorch to evaluate the CIFAR-10 dataset and to get a better accuracy than 70% (like a competitor).

## Explanation ##
There are the following files to use:
<ul>
  <li>Image Classifier Project.ipynb: This is the Jupyter Notebook i developed the code and trained the classifier. For submission a html-file is included. </li>
</ul>
